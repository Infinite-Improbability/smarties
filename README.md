**SMARTIES** (**S**pheroids **M**odelled **A**ccurately with a **R**obust **T**-matrix **I**mplementation for **E**lectromagnetic **S**cattering) is a suite of Matlab codes for the calculation of the optical properties of oblate and prolate spheroidal particles, with comparable capabilities and ease-of-use as Mie theory for spheres.

It provides a fully documented implementation of an improved T-matrix algorithm for the theoretical modelling of electromagnetic scattering by particles of spheroidal shape.

These codes include ready-to-use scripts to cover a range of scattering problems relevant to nanophotonics and plasmonics, including:

- Calculation of far-field scattering and absorption cross-sections for fixed incidence orientation
- Orientation-averaged cross-sections and scattering matrix
- Surface-field calculations, as well as near-fields
- Wavelength-dependent near-field and far-field properties
- Access to lower-level functions implementing the T-matrix calculations, including the T-matrix elements which may be calculated more accurately than with competing codes
